The error message "failed to get d-bus connection: Connection refused" indicates that the systemctl command failed to connect to the D-Bus system message bus, which is required for communicating with system services.

This error can occur for a few reasons, such as:

 - The D-Bus system message bus is not running.

 - The `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable is not set or is set incorrectly.

 - The user does not have permission to access the D-Bus system message bus.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

 - Check if the D-Bus system message bus is running by executing the command `sudo systemctl status dbus`. If it is not running, start it by executing the command `sudo systemctl start dbus`.

 - Check if the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is set by executing the command echo `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`. If it is not set or is set incorrectly, you can try setting it manually by executing the command `export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus`.

 - Check if the user has permission to access the D-Bus system message bus by executing the command `groups $USER` to check the user's group membership. The user should be a member of the `dbus` group. If not, add the user to the dbus group by executing the command `sudo usermod -aG dbus $USER`, and then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Once you have tried these steps, try running the `systemctl --user status` command again to see if the issue has been resolved.
