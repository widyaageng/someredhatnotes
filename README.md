The error message "failed to get d-bus connection: Connection refused" indicates that the systemctl command failed to connect to the D-Bus system message bus, which is required for communicating with system services.

This error can occur for a few reasons, such as:

 - The D-Bus system message bus is not running.

 - The `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable is not set or is set incorrectly.

 - The user does not have permission to access the D-Bus system message bus.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

 - Check if the D-Bus system message bus is running by executing the command `sudo systemctl status dbus`. If it is not running, start it by executing the command `sudo systemctl start dbus`.

 - Check if the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is set by executing the command echo `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`. If it is not set or is set incorrectly, you can try setting it manually by executing the command `export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus`.

 - Check if the user has permission to access the D-Bus system message bus by executing the command `groups $USER` to check the user's group membership. The user should be a member of the `dbus` group. If not, add the user to the dbus group by executing the command `sudo usermod -aG dbus $USER`, and then log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Once you have tried these steps, try running the `systemctl --user status` command again to see if the issue has been resolved.

why the output after executing this command `systemctl --user status` in docker container with 8.1 ubi redhat image is `Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory`
The systemctl command is used to control the systemd system and service manager, which manages the services running on the Linux operating system.

The error message "Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory" indicates that the command cannot connect to the D-Bus system bus, which is a system-wide message bus that allows communication between different processes on the same machine.

In a Docker container, the D-Bus system bus is not present by default because it's a system-wide resource, and a Docker container is an isolated environment. Therefore, when you run the systemctl command in a Docker container, you may encounter this error.

To solve this issue, you can either run the systemctl command as a privileged container, which has access to the host's systemd system, or use alternative commands to manage the services in the container, such as systemctl commands that only manipulate services within the container or other tools specific to the service or application you are running.

how to create new user in docker container beside root
---
To create a new user in a Docker container beside the root user, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and start a Docker container based on the image you want to use.

Once you're inside the container's shell, run the following command to create a new user:

php
Copy code
---
`adduser <username>`  
Replace <username> with the name you want to give to the new user.

Set a password for the new user by running the following command and following the prompts:

php
Copy code
---
`passwd <username>`  
Give the new user sudo privileges by adding them to the sudoers group. Run the following command:

php
Copy code
---
`usermod -aG sudo <username>`  
Exit the container's shell by typing exit or pressing Ctrl + D.
Now, you can log in to the container using the new user account by running the `su - <username>` command and entering the password you set earlier.

Note: Keep in mind that creating a new user in a Docker container can affect the portability and reproducibility of your Docker image, and it may not be recommended in certain cases.

command ps is not found in a docker container shell of redhat ubi image
The ps command is a standard Linux command used to display information about running processes. However, in some minimal Docker container images, this command might not be installed by default.

To use the ps command in a Docker container shell of a RedHat UBI image, you can try installing it by running the following command:

Copy code
---
`yum install -y procps-ng`  
This command installs the procps-ng package, which includes the ps command.

Once the installation is complete, you can run the ps command to display information about the running processes in the container.

what is the root password of docker container of redhat 8.1 ubi image
The RedHat Universal Base Image (UBI) does not set a root password by default. Instead, it uses the sudo command to elevate privileges for administrative tasks.

If you need to run commands as the root user within a Docker container based on the RedHat UBI image, you can use the sudo command to execute commands with elevated privileges. By default, the sudo command allows users in the wheel group to elevate privileges, so you can add your user to this group to gain access to sudo.

Here are the steps to add a user to the wheel group and grant sudo access:

Log in to the container as the default user, usually root or a non-root user created by your organization.

Run the following command to install the sudo package:

Copy code
---
`yum install -y sudo`  
Add your user to the wheel group:

php
Copy code
---
`usermod -aG wheel <username>`  
Replace <username> with the username you want to add to the wheel group.

Log out of the container and log back in to apply the changes.

Run any command requiring root privileges with sudo, followed by the command you want to execute. For example:

sql
Copy code
---
`sudo yum update`
This command updates the packages installed in the container.

Note that, depending on your organization's policies and the specific container you are using, the default user and group settings may be different. Be sure to consult the container documentation or your organization's guidelines for more information on user and group management.

what is the default password for root in docker image of redhat 8.1 ubi?  
<br>
By default, the RedHat Universal Base Image (UBI) for Docker does not set a password for the root user. Instead, it relies on other mechanisms for user authentication and authorization, such as sudo or key-based authentication.

When you start a Docker container based on the RedHat UBI image, you can use the sudo command to run administrative commands with elevated privileges, or you can configure key-based authentication for SSH access if required.

If you need to set a password for the root user, you can do so manually by logging in as the root user and using the passwd command to set the password. However, note that setting a password for the root user may introduce security risks, and it is generally recommended to use other authentication and authorization mechanisms instead.

how to start dbus service for user session
To start the D-Bus service for a user session in a Docker container, you can follow these steps:

Install the dbus-daemon package if it's not already installed in your container:

Copy code
---
`yum install -y dbus-daemon`  
Start the D-Bus daemon for the user session by running the following command:

css
Copy code
---
`dbus-daemon --session --fork`  
This command starts the D-Bus daemon in the current user session and forks it into the background.

Verify that the D-Bus daemon is running by running the following command:

css
Copy code
---
`dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames`  
<br>
This command sends a message to the D-Bus daemon requesting a list of names that are currently registered with the daemon. If the daemon is running correctly, you should see a list of names printed in the output.

That's it! The D-Bus service is now running for the user session in the Docker container. Note that the D-Bus service is generally used for inter-process communication and is not required for all applications, so you may not need to start it in every container.

Failed to start systemd-logind.service: The name org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1 was not provided by any .service files?  
<br>
The error message "Failed to start systemd-logind.service: The name org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1 was not provided by any .service files" indicates that the systemd-logind service is unable to start due to a missing dependency on the PolicyKit authentication framework.

PolicyKit is a system service that provides a way for unprivileged processes to authenticate and perform privileged actions. It is used by various system services, including systemd-logind, to manage user sessions, power management, and other system-level tasks.

To resolve this error, you can install the polkit package in your Docker container, which provides the necessary PolicyKit components. Here's how to do it:

Install the polkit package by running the following command:

Copy code
---
`yum install -y polkit`  
Once the polkit package is installed, start the polkitd service by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
---
`systemctl start polkit.service`  
Finally, start the systemd-logind service by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
---
`systemctl start systemd-logind.service`  
Verify that both services are running by running the following commands:

lua
Copy code
---
`systemctl status polkit.service`  
`systemctl status systemd-logind.service`  
<br>
If both services are running correctly, you should see output indicating that they are active and running.

That's it! The systemd-logind service should now be able to start without any errors related to missing dependencies.

Failed to start systemd-logind.service: Interactive authentication required.
The error message "Failed to start systemd-logind.service: Interactive authentication required." indicates that the systemd-logind service requires interactive authentication in order to start, but it is not able to authenticate with the necessary privileges to start the service.

This error can occur if the user attempting to start the service does not have the necessary permissions to do so, or if there is a problem with the authentication system or the PolicyKit service that provides authentication for system services.

To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:

**Make sure you are running the systemctl command as the root user** or a user with the necessary permissions to start system services. You can switch to the root user by running the following command:

Copy code
---
`su -`  
Check the status of the polkit service by running the following command:

lua
Copy code
---
`systemctl status polkit.service`  
If the polkit service is not running, start it by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
---
`systemctl start polkit.service`  
Try starting the systemd-logind service again by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
---
`systemctl start systemd-logind.service`  
If the service still fails to start, you may need to provide additional authentication credentials using the pkexec command. For example, you can try running the following command:

sql
Copy code
---
`pkexec systemctl start systemd-logind.service`  
This command will prompt you for your authentication credentials and may allow the systemd-logind service to start successfully.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, there may be a problem with the authentication system or the PolicyKit service on your system. You can try reinstalling the polkit package and checking for any errors or messages related to authentication in the system logs.

That's it! By following these steps, you should be able to start the systemd-logind service and resolve the "Interactive authentication required" error.

Failed to start systemd-logind.service: Unit systemd-logind.service is masked.  
<br>
The error message "Failed to start systemd-logind.service: Unit systemd-logind.service is masked" indicates that the systemd-logind service is currently masked, which means it has been intentionally disabled or blocked from starting by the system administrator or an installed package.

When a service is masked, it cannot be started or enabled using the systemctl command. This is a security feature that can prevent accidental or unauthorized changes to system services.

To unmask the systemd-logind service and allow it to start, you can try the following steps:

Check the status of the systemd-logind service by running the following command:

lua
Copy code
---
`systemctl status systemd-logind.service`  
This command will display information about the service, including whether it is masked.

If the service is masked, unmask it by running the following command:

Copy code
---
`systemctl unmask systemd-logind.service`  
This will remove the mask from the service and allow it to be started.

Try starting the systemd-logind service again by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
---
`systemctl start systemd-logind.service`  
If the service still fails to start, check the system logs for any errors or messages related to the systemd-logind service. You can use the journalctl command to view the system logs. For example, you can run the following command to view the last 50 lines of the system logs:

Copy code
---
`journalctl -n 50`  
Look for any errors or messages related to the systemd-logind service that may indicate why it is not starting.

That's it! By following these steps, you should be able to unmask and start the systemd-logind service.
